# üëãIntroduction of AppBase 
**AppBase** is a set of libraries designed for .NET based application. Currently there are 2 modules providing the following functions:

üì¶CarinaStudio.AppBase.Core
 * Extensions for ```System.Object``` and ```System.IDisposable``` to make your code more elegant and clear. ([Learn more](https://github.com/carina-studio/AppBase/tree/master/Core#extensions-for-systemobject))
 * Extensions for arrays and ```System.Memory<T>``` to get memory address.
* Extended ```System.IDisposable``` to make it easier to share resources across components in your application.
* Extensions for ```System.Collections.Generic.*``` for collection state checking and searching. ([Learn more](https://github.com/carina-studio/AppBase/tree/master/Core/Collections#extensions-for-systemcollectionsgenericicollectiont))
* Extensions for ```System.Threading.SynchronizationContext``` for delayed call-back support. ([Learn mode](https://github.com/carina-studio/AppBase/tree/master/Core/Threading#extensions-for-systemthreadingsynchronizationcontext))
* Implementations of ```System.Threading.SynchronizationContext``` and ```System.Threading.Tasks.TaskScheduler``` to let you schedule and run tasks on dedicated threads. ([Learn more](https://github.com/carina-studio/AppBase/tree/master/Core/Threading#singlethreadsynchronizationcontext))
* Schedulable action to execute action later and prevent duplicate execution. ([Learn more](https://github.com/carina-studio/AppBase/tree/master/Core/Threading#scheduledaction))
* Implementation of ```System.IObservable<T>``` to support observable value/field just like ```LiveData<T>``` on Android. ([Learn more](https://github.com/carina-studio/AppBase/tree/master/Core#observablevaluet))

üì¶CarinaStudio.AppBase.Configuration
* Class for key-value based application settings which supports various type of value.
* Save application settings to given file.
* Extensible settings serialization/deserializing. Implementations based-on JSON and XML format are included.
